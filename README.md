# **EDA Assignment: Road Traffic Accident Dataset**

Welcome to the **EDA Project**! In this assignment, you will perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a road traffic accident dataset.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains road traffic accidents in Addis Ababa from 2017 to 2020. It includes **32 features** and **12,316 instances**. You are required to clean and preprocess the dataset, then perform various EDA tasks on it.

- **[RTA Dataset.csv]**: The raw dataset.
- **[cleaned.csv]**: Preprocessed and cleaned dataset (to be created by you).

## **EDA Tasks**
Follow the steps below to complete the EDA. Your goal is to gain insights from the data by performing the following tasks:

### **1. Load and Inspect the Data**
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Inspect the first few rows and understand the structure of the data using `data.head()`.
- Check the shape of the dataset using `data.shape`.
  
### **2. Problem Statement**
- Understand the problem you are solving. In this case, the goal is to analyze the road traffic accident data to identify patterns and potentially predict accident severity, causes, or other relevant factors.

### **3. Clean the Data**

### **5. Descriptive Statistics**

### **6. Visualize the Data**

### **7. Feature Engineering**
- Create or modify features to improve your analysis.
- This may include:
  - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., using one-hot encoding or label encoding).
  - Creating new features based on existing ones, such as time-based features (e.g., accident month, weekday).
  - Normalizing or scaling numerical features if necessary.

### **8. Outlier Detection and Removal**
- Identify outliers using box plots, z-scores, or IQR (Interquartile Range).
- Remove or handle outliers that might distort the analysis.

### **9. Handling Class Imbalance**
- Analyze the distribution of target labels (accident severity or other classification targets).
- Visualize the imbalance using bar charts or count plots.
- If necessary, address the imbalance by:
  - Using techniques like **undersampling** or **oversampling**.
  - Applying **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes.

### **10. Insights and Patterns**
- Derive meaningful insights from the data, such as:
  - What are the most common causes of accidents?
  - Are there particular times, locations, or conditions that lead to more accidents?
  - Identify patterns and relationships that could be useful for predicting accident severity or frequency.

### **11. Save and Document**
- Save the cleaned and preprocessed dataset to a new CSV file (e.g., `cleaned.csv`).
- Document your findings and the steps you took to clean and analyze the data.

### **Important Notes:**
- **Structure:** Make sure your code is well-organized and structured. Use comments where necessary to explain what each section of your code is doing.
- **Documentation:** Document your thought process and findings clearly. Each step should be well-documented so that anyone reading your work can follow the logic and reasoning behind it.
- **Code Quality:** Ensure that your code is clean and efficient. Avoid redundant code and aim for clarity and simplicity.

# **Steps to Use GitHub**

### **1. Fork the Repository**
- **Forking** creates your own copy of the repository, so you can make changes without affecting the original repository.
- To fork the repository, click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the repository page.

### **2. Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine**
- After forking the repository, you need to **clone** it to your local machine to start working on it.
- Open the terminal or Git Bash on your computer, and run the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/EDA-Assignment.git
